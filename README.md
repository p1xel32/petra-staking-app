Welcome to the **aptcore.one Staking Interface**, a user-friendly web application for staking $APT tokens on the Aptos blockchain. This platform offers a simple, clean, and modern way to delegate your $APT to the official **aptcore.one validator delegation pool** and effectively manage your crypto staking rewards.

**üíª Live Application: [Stake your $APT with aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one/)**

*This application serves as the official staking interface for the [aptcore.one validator](https://aptcore.one/), providing a dedicated and optimized Aptos staking experience for its delegators. The underlying source code (from the `petra-staking-app` repository) is publicly available for transparency and for community members who may wish to adapt it for other Aptos validators.*

Built with cutting-edge web technologies: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk`, and `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react`.

## üöÄ Getting Started Locally (For Developers or Custom Use)

To run this Aptos staking application on your local machine (e.g., for contributing to development or to configure it for a different Aptos validator):

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version is recommended for compatibility)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager

### Installation & Local Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/p1xel32/petra-staking-app.git](https://github.com/p1xel32/petra-staking-app.git)
    cd petra-staking-app
    ```

2.  **Install Project Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # Alternatively, if you use yarn:
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # Alternatively, if you use yarn:
    # yarn dev
    ```
    The application should now be accessible locally, typically at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite will indicate the port).

## üîß Configuration: Using with a Different Aptos Validator

The live deployment at [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one/) is specifically pre-configured for the `aptcore.one` validator pool. If you have cloned this repository and intend to use this interface with a *different* Aptos validator's delegation pool, please follow these modification steps:

1.  **Identify the Target Validator's Pool Address:** You will need the unique `owner` address (often referred to as the pool address or staking pool address) of your chosen Aptos validator. This address can usually be found on Aptos blockchain explorers (e.g., AptoScan, Aptos Explorer) or through the validator's official communication channels.
2.  **Update Configuration Constants:** Modify the `VALIDATOR_POOL_ADDRESS` constant within the specified source files. Replace the existing address with the new validator pool address:
    * `src/components/ValidatorInfo.jsx`
    * `src/components/StakeUnstakeControls.jsx`

    ```javascript
    // Example: Modify this line in both indicated files
    const VALIDATOR_POOL_ADDRESS = '0xNEW_VALIDATOR_POOL_ADDRESS_HERE'; // Replace with the actual address
    ```
3.  **Restart Development Server or Rebuild Application:**
    * If your local development server is active, stop it (Ctrl+C) and restart it (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`).
    * For production deployments (if you are self-hosting), you must rebuild the application (`npm run build` or `yarn build`) and then redeploy the updated build.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer: Risks of Staking Crypto

Engaging in staking of digital assets, including $APT tokens on the Aptos network, carries inherent risks. These risks include, but are not limited to: potential vulnerabilities within smart contracts (though core Aptos staking contracts are audited by the Aptos Foundation), impermanent loss (if applicable to the asset, though less so for direct staking), and the mandatory lock-up period associated with staking, during which your funds are not immediately liquid or accessible after initiating an unstake request.

This application provides an interface to interact directly with the Aptos blockchain. **You are solely responsible for your actions, decisions, and the security of your private keys and funds.** Always conduct thorough due diligence and your own research (DYOR) before participating in any staking activities or blockchain interactions. The creators and maintainers of this application are not fiduciaries and shall not be liable for any losses, damages, or adverse outcomes you may experience.
