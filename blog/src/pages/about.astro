        Welcome to aptcore.one! We are a dedicated team passionate about the Aptos blockchain 
        and its potential to revolutionize decentralized applications. Our primary goal is to provide
        a secure, reliable, and user-friendly staking service for Aptos (APT) token holders.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2> {/* Tailwind Typography will style this h2 */}
      <p>
        Our core mission is to empower individuals to participate actively in the Aptos network's security 
        and governance through staking. We strive to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maximize Rewards:</strong> Offer competitive returns for our delegators through efficient validator operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure Security:</strong> Implement robust security measures and best practices to safeguard our infrastructure and, by extension, the network.</li>
        <li><strong>Promote Transparency:</strong> Provide clear, honest information about staking mechanics, reward structures (APR vs. APY), and our operational performance. We believe an informed delegator is an empowered delegator.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplify Staking:</strong> Make the delegation process accessible and understandable for everyone, regardless of their technical expertise.</li>
      </ul>
