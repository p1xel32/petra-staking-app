    question: 'What is Aptos (APT) staking?',
    answer: 'Aptos (APT) staking is the process where token holders participate in the network\'s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus by delegating their APT to a validator node, contributing to network security and earning rewards.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-does-aptos-staking-work',
    question: 'How does Aptos staking work?',
    answer: 'APT holders delegate their tokens to a validator or delegation pool. Validators use this stake to validate transactions and propose blocks, earning rewards that are then shared with their delegators. Aptos uses an "owner-operator-voter" model for staking roles.'
  },
  {
    id: 'what-are-benefits-of-staking-aptos-apt',
    question: 'What are the benefits of staking Aptos (APT)?',
    answer: 'Staking APT allows you to earn rewards, contribute to the Aptos network\'s security and integrity, and potentially prevent dilution of your asset share as new tokens are minted.'
  },
  {
    id: 'what-happens-when-i-stake-my-apt',
    question: 'What happens when I stake my APT?',
    answer: 'When you stake APT, you pledge your tokens to a validator, increasing their total stake and potential to validate transactions and earn rewards, which are then shared with you as a delegator.'
  },
  {
    id: 'is-staked-apt-locked',
    question: 'Is staked APT locked?',
    answer: 'Yes, staked APT is locked and cannot be used for transactions. To make it liquid, you must first unstake it, which involves an unbonding period before the tokens become available.'
  },
  {
    id: 'what-is-owner-operator-voter-model-staking-aptos',
    question: 'What is the "owner-operator-voter model for staking" in Aptos?',
    answer: 'This model separates account roles for enhanced security: the \'Owner\' holds the funds, the \'Operator\' runs the validator node, and the \'Voter\' participates in on-chain governance. This allows secure delegation of operational or voting duties.'
  },

  // Staking Process & Requirements
  {
    id: 'how-do-i-stake-apt',
    question: 'How do I stake APT?',
    answer: 'You can stake APT through various Aptos-compatible wallets (like Petra) or staking platforms. This typically involves choosing a validator, entering the amount to stake, and confirming the transaction via your wallet.'
  },
  {
    id: 'what-is-minimum-amount-to-start-staking-apt',
    question: 'What is the minimum amount I need to start staking?',
    answer: 'The minimum amount varies. Some platforms like Exodus or Stakely allow staking with as little as 11 APT. However, for a validator to join the active set, they need 1 million APT.'
  },
  {
    id: 'minimum-additional-apt-to-stake',
    question: 'If I am already staking APT and want to stake additional APT, what is the minimum?',
    answer: 'For adding to an existing stake, some platforms like Exodus have a lower minimum, such as 0.1 APT.'
  },
  {
    id: 'apt-minimum-reserve-in-wallet',
    question: 'What is the APT minimum reserve I need to keep in my wallet?',
    answer: 'Some wallets (e.g., Exodus) may reserve a small amount of APT (e.g., 0.05 APT) to cover future transaction fees for actions like unstaking or claiming rewards.'
  },
  {
    id: 'are-there-transaction-fees-for-staking-apt',
    question: 'Are there transaction fees for staking APT?',
    answer: 'Yes, network transaction fees, paid in APT, apply for staking, unstaking, and claiming rewards to cover the computational resources used by the Aptos network.'
  },
  {
    id: 'which-validator-delegating-funds-to',
    question: 'Which validator will I be delegating my funds to (e.g., when using Exodus)?',
    answer: 'If you don\'t choose directly, the platform may select one. For example, Exodus uses Everstake as its staking provider, so funds are delegated to Everstake\'s validators. Other services like P2P.org are direct validators.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-long-for-apt-to-finish-staking',
    question: 'How long does it take for APT to finish staking after the request?',
    answer: 'Typically, it takes about 2 hours (one epoch) for APT to be fully staked and begin participating in network consensus after the staking transaction is confirmed.'
  },
  {
    id: 'do-funds-move-out-wallet-when-staking',
    question: 'Do funds move out to another wallet when I stake (e.g., with Kiln)?',
    answer: 'With non-custodial staking solutions like Kiln, tokens may move to a staking contract, but your account retains sole authority to unstake, ensuring you maintain custody of your funds.'
  },
  {
    id: 'can-i-select-how-much-wallet-balance-to-stake-apt',
    question: 'Can I select how much of my wallet balance I want to stake?',
    answer: 'Generally, yes. Users can typically select the specific amount of APT from their available balance they wish to stake, subject to any platform or protocol minimums.'
  },
  {
    id: 'why-is-my-apt-validator-inactive',
    question: 'Why is my APT validator inactive (e.g., P2P.org)?',
    answer: 'A validator might be inactive if its pool has not yet reached the minimum total stake required by the protocol (1 million APT) or by the specific pool\'s rules to become active and earn rewards.'
  },

  // Staking Rewards
  {
    id: 'how-often-aptos-staking-rewards-distributed',
    question: 'How often are Aptos staking rewards distributed?',
    answer: 'Aptos staking rewards are distributed at the end of every epoch, which is approximately every 2 hours (7200 seconds).'
  },
  {
    id: 'are-aptos-staking-rewards-auto-compounded',
    question: 'Are staking rewards automatically added to the active stake (compounded)?',
    answer: 'Yes, staking rewards on Aptos are automatically compounded. Earned rewards are added to your staked principal, and future rewards are calculated on this new, larger balance.'
  },
  {
    id: 'when-will-i-start-earning-rewards-after-staking-apt',
    question: 'When will I start earning rewards after staking?',
    answer: 'You will start earning rewards once your APT is fully staked (typically after about 2 hours or at the start of the next epoch), with rewards distributed at the end of each subsequent epoch.'
  },
  {
    id: 'do-i-need-to-claim-my-apt-rewards',
    question: 'Do I need to claim my APT rewards?',
    answer: 'No, because Aptos staking rewards are auto-compounded, you generally do not need to manually claim them; they are automatically added to your staked balance.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-are-aptos-staking-rewards-calculated',
    question: 'How are staking rewards calculated?',
    answer: 'Rewards depend on the network\'s `rewards_rate` (APY), your total staked APT amount, and for validators, their proposer performance. Staking services may also deduct a commission.'
  },
  {
    id: 'what-is-rewards-rate-apy-for-staking-apt',
    question: 'What is the `rewards_rate` or APY for staking APT?',
    answer: 'The maximum reward rate starts at 7% annually and is designed to decrease by 1.5% per year to a lower bound of 3.25% annually over 50+ years. The current APY can be seen in some wallets or on staking platforms.'
  },
  {
    id: 'what-is-nrr-network-reward-rate-aptos',
    question: 'What is NRR (Network Reward Rate) in Aptos network?',
    answer: 'NRR refers to the overall potential rewards distributed by the Aptos network to participants (stakers and validators) for their contribution to network security and operations.'
  },
  {
    id: 'are-validator-rewards-subject-to-lockup-aptos',
    question: 'Are validator rewards also subject to a lockup period?',
    answer: 'Yes, rewards earned by validators are added to their staked principal and are subject to the same lockup conditions as the original stake.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-is-balance-computed-epoch-n-rewards-distribution-aptos',
    question: 'How is my balance computed at epoch N for rewards distribution (e.g., with Kiln)?',
    answer: 'For reward calculation for epoch N, the balance used is typically the staked balance at the beginning of the preceding epoch (N-1), as stated by providers like Kiln.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-is-commission-paid-to-validators-operators-aptos',
    question: 'How is commission paid to validators/operators?',
    answer: 'Validators or staking services charge a commission on the rewards earned by their delegators. This is often paid when delegators unstake or can be requested by the operator after the lockup for associated rewards ends.'
  },

  // Unstaking Process & Lockup
  {
    id: 'how-do-i-unstake-apt',
    question: 'How do I unstake APT?',
    answer: 'To unstake APT, you typically use your wallet or staking platform\'s interface to initiate an "unstake" or "unlock" request for your staked balance.'
  },
  {
    id: 'is-there-unstaking-period-aptos',
    question: 'Is there an unstaking period (unbonding/lockup period) for Aptos?',
    answer: 'Yes, Aptos has an unstaking or unbonding period during which tokens are no longer actively staking but are not yet available for transfer.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-long-is-unstaking-period-aptos',
    question: 'How long is the unstaking period? / How long until my APT finishes unstaking?',
    answer: 'The unstaking period can vary, often ranging from a few hours up to 30 days. It depends on the staking provider\'s cycle and when the unstake request is made relative to the 30-day lockup period determined by governance.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-does-unstaking-work-aptos',
    question: 'How does unstaking work (e.g., on Exodus)?',
    answer: 'When you initiate unstaking (e.g., on Exodus), your entire staked balance plus rewards are marked for unbonding. You must wait until the end of the current 30-day lockup period for them to become available for claiming.'
  },
  {
    id: 'can-i-unstake-part-of-staked-balance-aptos',
    question: 'Can I unstake part of the staked balance?',
    answer: 'This depends on the provider. Some platforms like Kiln allow partial unstaking (e.g., minimum 10 APT). Others, like Exodus as described, might require unstaking the entire balance.'
  },
  {
    id: 'do-i-need-to-claim-unstaked-apt-after-period-ends',
    question: 'Do I need to claim my unstaked APT after the unstaking period ends?',
    answer: 'Yes, on some platforms like Exodus, after the unstaking period completes and APT is unlocked, you must perform a separate "claim" transaction to return the funds to your main wallet balance.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-can-i-withdraw-my-apt-unstaked-unlocked',
    question: 'How can I withdraw my APT (unstaked and unlocked funds)?',
    answer: 'Once APT has completed the unbonding period and any necessary claim steps, it becomes available in your wallet. You can then withdraw or transfer it like any other liquid balance.'
  },
  {
    id: 'does-unlocked-stake-continue-earning-rewards-aptos',
    question: 'Does unlocked stake continue earning rewards until it becomes withdrawable?',
    answer: 'Yes, APT that is in the process of unbonding (unlocked stake) generally continues to earn staking rewards until it becomes fully withdrawable.'
  },
  {
    id: 'when-can-validator-request-unlock-stake-aptos',
    question: 'When can a validator request to unlock their stake?',
    answer: 'A validator can request to unlock their stake at any time. However, the funds become withdrawable only when their current lockup period (set by governance) expires.'
  },

  // Staking Risks & Security
  {
    id: 'is-staking-apt-safe',
    question: 'Is staking APT safe?',
    answer: 'Staking APT, especially through non-custodial solutions where you control your keys, is generally considered safe from theft of principal by the platform. However, like all crypto activities, it carries market risks and potential smart contract risks.'
  },
  {
    id: 'is-there-slashing-risk-on-aptos',
    question: 'Is there a slashing risk on Aptos?',
    answer: 'Currently, slashing (penalty for validator misbehavior or downtime leading to loss of staked tokens) is not activated or implemented on the Aptos blockchain. This reduces a common staking risk.'
  },

  // Advanced Staking & Validator Operations
  {
    id: 'what-are-different-states-validator-can-be-in-aptos',
    question: 'What are the different states a validator can be in?',
    answer: 'A validator on Aptos can be: `inactive` (not in validator set), `pending_active` (waiting to join), `active` (participating in consensus), or `pending_inactive` (transitioning out). Transitions usually occur at epoch boundaries.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-does-validator-move-between-states-aptos',
    question: 'How does a validator move between these states?',
    answer: 'Validators transition between states (e.g., `pending_active` to `active`) at epoch boundaries based on meeting staking requirements, operator actions, or governance decisions.'
  },
  {
    id: 'what-happens-if-validator-stake-falls-below-minimum-aptos',
    question: 'What happens if a validator\'s stake falls below the minimum required?',
    answer: 'If an active validator\'s stake drops below the 1 million APT minimum, they will be moved from the `active` state directly to `inactive` during an epoch change, ceasing participation in consensus.'
  },
  {
    id: 'what-is-minimum-maximum-stake-for-validator-aptos',
    question: 'What is the minimum/maximum stake amount for a validator?',
    answer: 'The minimum stake for a validator to join the active set is 1 million APT. The maximum stake amount per validator is currently 50 million APT.'
  },
  {
    id: 'what-happens-if-validator-stake-exceeds-maximum-aptos',
    question: 'What happens if a validator\'s staked amount exceeds the maximum allowed?',
    answer: 'If a validator\'s stake exceeds the maximum (e.g., 50 million APT), their voting power and reward calculations will be based only on the maximum allowed amount, not their total current stake.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-does-operator-join-validator-set-aptos',
    question: 'How does an operator join the validator set?',
    answer: 'An operator must run a validator node, configure its on-chain addresses and consensus key. The owner deposits the minimum 1 million APT stake. The node syncs and participates once the stake pool becomes active, then earns rewards.'
  },
  {
    id: 'can-validator-consensus-key-network-addresses-change-aptos',
    question: 'Can a validator\'s consensus key or network addresses change?',
    answer: 'Yes, a validator\'s consensus key and network addresses can be changed, but these changes only take effect at an epoch boundary.'
  },
  {
    id: 'connect-validator-to-vfn-not-other-way-around-aptos',
    question: 'Is there a way to connect a Validator to a VFN (Validator FullNode) and not the other way around?',
    answer: 'Aptos documentation details validator and fullnode configurations. Typically, VFNs connect to validators, but specific advanced setups may require consulting technical guides or community forums.'
  },
  {
    id: 'minimum-faucet-for-stake-create-staking-contract-aptos',
    question: 'Minimum faucet for stake `create-staking-contract` and how to get it?',
    answer: 'This refers to needing testnet tokens to interact with staking contracts in a development/testing environment. Testnet APT can usually be obtained from a designated Aptos testnet faucet.'
