    answer: 'Move 2.x (referring to versions of Move post initial launch, incorporating significant AIPs) introduced advanced features enhancing expressiveness and capabilities: \n1. **Function Values (Storable Functions):** Allows functions to be treated as values—passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and stored in resources. This enables patterns like callbacks, strategy patterns, and dynamic dispatch tables. Safe usage involves understanding their interaction with Move\'s ownership and borrowing system, ensuring type safety, and managing their lifecycle correctly, especially when stored. \n2. **Enhanced Safe Dynamic Dispatch:** Provides mechanisms for more flexible (yet still safe) dynamic calls between modules, often leveraging function values or trait-like interfaces. While Move aims for safer dynamic dispatch than some other chains (e.g., by making access control part of type definitions), developers must still be cautious about reentrancy patterns (though Move has built-in reentrancy locks for public functions) and ensure proper permissioning and validation for dynamic calls. \n**Effective & Safe Use:** \n* Thoroughly understand Move\'s type system, ownership, and reference safety, especially how these new features interact with them. \n* Write comprehensive unit tests and consider formal verification for contracts using these advanced features. \n* Study official examples and documentation from Aptos Labs on these specific features. \n* Be aware of potential new classes of logical errors if not used with care.  ',

There were comments about the app not being widely used by Expo vendors. \n* **NFT Value Proposition:** Some users expressed confusion about the purpose or long-term value of the MYAKU-N! NFTs beyond being a "fun little digital stamp rally," questioning their utility. \n* **Web3 Onboarding:** The wallet was designed for mass adoption without prior blockchain knowledge. While some found it user-friendly, the reported usability issues sometimes overshadowed the simplified Web3 aspects. \nThis initiative served as a critical real-world test for Aptos in mainstream Web3 adoption, highlighting challenges in app usability and communicating the value of blockchain features to a non-native audience.',

    question: 'Are there transaction fees associated with staking, unstaking, or claiming APT rewards?',
    answer: 'Yes, all operations on the Aptos blockchain, including staking, unstaking, and (if applicable) claiming rewards, are transactions that require network fees. These fees are paid in APT and cover the computational resources used by the network.',

    id: 'which-validator-delegating-funds-to',
    question: 'If I use a third-party wallet or platform for staking, how do I know which validator my APT is delegated to?',
    answer: 'Some wallets or platforms may automatically delegate your APT to a specific partner validator (e.g., Exodus historically used Everstake). Ideally, the platform should clearly display which validator your funds are being delegated to. When staking directly with a service like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one), you are choosing us as your validator.',

    id: 'how-long-for-apt-to-finish-staking',
    question: 'After I initiate a staking transaction, how long does it take for my APT to be considered fully staked and start earning rewards?',
    answer: 'Once your staking transaction is confirmed on the Aptos blockchain, your APT typically becomes fully staked and eligible to earn rewards at the beginning of the next epoch. An epoch on Aptos is approximately two hours long.',

  {
    id: 'do-funds-move-out-wallet-when-staking',
    question: 'When I stake my APT using a non-custodial solution, do my funds move out of my wallet to another wallet?',
    answer: 'With non-custodial staking, your APT tokens are typically delegated to a smart contract associated with the validator you choose. While they are locked and committed to staking, you retain ownership and control via your wallet\'s private keys. The funds do not move to the validator\'s personal wallet; you always have the sole authority to initiate unstaking.',

  {
    id: 'can-i-select-how-much-wallet-balance-to-stake-apt',
    question: 'Can I choose to stake only a portion of my APT wallet balance?',

    category: "Staking Process & Requirements"
  },
  {
    id: 'why-is-my-apt-validator-inactive',
    question: 'I delegated to an APT validator, but it shows as "inactive". Why would this happen?',
    answer: 'A validator might be inactive if its total pooled stake (from the operator and all delegators) has not yet reached the minimum threshold required by the Aptos protocol (currently 1 million APT) to join the active validator set. It will remain pending until it meets this threshold and can then become active at an epoch change.',

  },
  {
    id: 'how-are-aptos-staking-rewards-calculated-detailed',
    question: 'Can you provide more details on how Aptos staking rewards are calculated?',
    answer: 'Staking rewards are influenced by several factors: the network\'s overall `rewards_rate` (APY), the total amount of APT you have staked, the chosen validator\'s performance (uptime and success in proposing blocks), and the commission rate charged by the validator. Higher stake and better validator performance generally lead to higher rewards, minus the validator\'s commission.

    question: 'Are the rewards earned by validators also subject to a lockup period?',
    answer: 'Yes, rewards earned by validators (both their self-stake and the portion due to delegators before commission) are typically added to their staked principal. As such, these rewards are subject to the same lockup and unbonding conditions as the original staked amounts until an unstaking process is initiated.',

  // Category: Unstaking Process & Lockup
  {

    question: 'What are the steps to unstake my APT tokens?',
    answer: 'To unstake APT, you will typically use the interface of the wallet or staking platform (like [aptcore.one\'s dashboard](https://aptcore.one)) where you initially staked your tokens. You\'ll look for an "unstake," "unlock," or "withdraw stake" option, specify the amount (if partial unstaking is supported), and confirm the transaction. This initiates the unbonding period.',

    id: 'is-there-unstaking-period-aptos',
    question: 'Is there an unstaking (unbonding or lockup) period when I decide to unstake my Aptos (APT)?',
    answer: 'Yes, the Aptos network has an unbonding period. When you request to unstake your APT, the tokens enter this period during which they are no longer actively earning new staking rewards but are not yet liquid or available for transfer.',

  },
  {
    id: 'how-long-is-unstaking-period-aptos',
    question: 'How long is the unstaking/unbonding period for Aptos? When will my APT be available after unstaking?',
    answer: 'The unstaking lockup period on Aptos is determined by on-chain governance and is typically around 14 days. Your APT tokens become available for withdrawal after this 14-day period concludes, often aligning with the end of the specific lockup cycle your stake was part of when you initiated the unstake.',

  },
  {
    id: 'how-does-unstaking-work-aptos-detailed',
    question: 'Can you explain the Aptos unstaking process in more detail?',
    answer: 'When you initiate an unstake request, your specified amount of staked APT (plus any auto-compounded rewards associated with that principal) is marked for unbonding. These tokens stop earning new rewards. They remain locked for the duration of the current on-chain lockup period (e.g., 14 days). After this period expires, you must typically execute a final "withdraw" transaction to move the unlocked APT back to your liquid wallet balance.',

    question: 'Can I unstake only a portion of my staked APT balance, or do I have to unstake everything?',
    answer: 'The ability to perform partial unstaking depends on the specific staking smart contract or the interface provided by your wallet/staking platform. Some solutions allow you to specify an amount to unstake (subject to minimums), while others might require unstaking the entire balance associated with a particular delegation or stake pool entry.',

    question: 'After the unbonding period ends, do I need to manually claim my unstaked APT to make it liquid?',
    answer: 'Yes, typically on Aptos, after your staked APT has completed the unbonding (lockup) period, you must perform an additional transaction to "withdraw" or "claim" these unlocked tokens. This final step moves them from the staking contract back to your main wallet balance, making them spendable.',

    answer: 'A validator operator can submit a request to unlock their stake (or a portion of it, if supported by their pool setup) at any time. However, similar to delegators, the staked APT will only become withdrawable after the prevailing on-chain lockup period (e.g., 14 days from the last lock action for that stake) has expired.',

    answer: 'Staking APT involves certain risks, but choosing a reputable validator like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one) can mitigate some of them. With non-custodial staking, you retain control of your private keys, meaning the validator cannot directly access your funds. However, risks include: 1. **Market Risk:** The price of APT can fluctuate. 2. **Slashing Risk:** (See next question). 3. **Validator Downtime:** If a validator has poor uptime, it can affect your rewards. 4. **Smart Contract Bugs:** Though Move is designed for safety, no software is entirely without risk.

    id: 'is-there-slashing-risk-on-aptos',
    question: 'Is there a "slashing" risk when staking Aptos (APT)? What is it?',
    answer: 'Slashing is a penalty mechanism in Proof-of-Stake blockchains where a validator (and consequently their delegators) can lose a portion of their staked tokens for malicious behavior (like double-signing transactions) or extended downtime. While the Aptos protocol is designed with the capability for slashing, its activation and specific conditions are subject to on-chain governance. It\'s important to check the current network parameters and choose a reliable validator like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one) to minimize such risks if slashing is active.',

    question: 'How does an Aptos validator transition between these different operational states?',
    answer: 'Validators transition between states primarily at epoch boundaries. For example:\n- Joining: An operator registers, the owner stakes, and if minimums are met, the validator moves to `pending_active`, then `active`.\n- Leaving: An operator requests to leave, moving to `pending_inactive`, then `inactive`.\n- Forced Exit: If an active validator\'s stake falls below the minimum, it moves directly to `inactive`.\nThese transitions are managed by the Aptos protocol based on operator actions, stake levels, and governance.',

    question: 'What happens if an active validator\'s total stake falls below the minimum required by the Aptos network?',
    answer: 'If an active validator\'s total stake (including all delegations) drops below the network minimum (currently 1 million APT), the validator will be moved from the `active` state directly to an `inactive` state during the next epoch change.

    question: 'What is the minimum and maximum stake amount for an Aptos validator to be active and earn rewards effectively?',
    answer: 'To join and remain in the active validator set on Aptos, a validator must have a minimum total stake of 1 million APT. There is also a maximum effective stake per validator, currently 50 million APT. Stake beyond this maximum does not contribute further to the validator\'s voting power or reward share.',

    answer: 'If a validator\'s total stake (e.g., 60 million APT) exceeds the maximum effective stake limit (e.g., 50 million APT), their voting power in consensus and their share of network rewards will be calculated as if their stake is only at that maximum limit. The additional stake beyond the cap does not provide extra rewards or voting influence for that specific validator node.

Install and configure the Aptos node software. 3. Generate and register on-chain the necessary accounts and keys (owner, operator, voter, consensus key, network identities). 4. The owner account must stake the minimum required APT (1 million) into the validator\'s stake pool. 5. The node must sync with the blockchain. 6.

    question: 'Is it possible to configure an Aptos Validator node to initiate a connection to its VFN (Validator FullNode), rather than the VFN always connecting to the Validator?',
    answer: 'The standard Aptos network configuration involves Validator FullNodes (VFNs) being configured to connect to their associated Validator node to form a private fullnode network for resilience and security. For highly specific or alternative network topologies where a Validator might initiate outbound connections to its VFNs, you would need to consult advanced Aptos technical documentation or seek advice from the Aptos developer community, as this is not the typical setup.',
