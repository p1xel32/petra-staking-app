        <p class="text-sm italic text-zinc-400">By using the website https://aptcore.one (the "Site") and any related services (the "Services"), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this disclaimer.</p>

        <h2>1. General Statement</h2>
        <p>The information provided on the Site, including but not limited to blog posts, guides, and performance metrics, is for general informational purposes only. All information is provided in good faith; however, we make no representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, adequacy, validity, reliability, availability, or completeness of any information on the Site.</p>

        <h2>2. No Financial, Investment, or Legal Advice</h2>
        <p>The content on this Site does not constitute investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other sort of advice. You must not treat any of the Site's content as such. We do not recommend that any cryptocurrency should be bought, sold, held, or staked by you. We strongly recommend that you consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any financial decisions.</p>

        <h2>3. Comprehensive Risk Disclosure & Assumption of Risk</h2>
        <p>By choosing to stake your Aptos (APT) tokens, you voluntarily assume all associated risks, which could result in the partial or total loss of your assets. The primary risks include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market & Price Volatility Risk:</strong> The value of your staked APT can decrease significantly, potentially resulting in losses greater than any staking rewards earned.</li>
            <li><strong>Slashing Risk:</strong> A portion or all of your staked APT can be permanently lost if the validator makes a critical error or is attacked. While we have a zero-slashing history, this does not eliminate future risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Protocol & Smart Contract Risk:</strong> Flaws or bugs in the underlying Aptos blockchain protocol itself could lead to the irreversible loss of your funds.</li>
            <li><strong>Liquidity & Unbonding Risk:</strong> Your staked APT is locked for a protocol-defined period during which you cannot sell or transfer it.</li>
            <li><strong>Validator Downtime Risk:</strong> You may forfeit potential staking rewards if the validator goes offline.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> Future laws or regulations may change, negatively impacting the legality, tax treatment, or value of staking.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. No Guarantees or Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Any performance data displayed (APY, rank, etc.) is purely historical or illustrative and is not an indicator of future results. We explicitly disclaim all warranties.</p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Under no circumstances shall we be liable for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages, including lost profit, lost revenue, or loss of data, arising from your use of the Services or your decision to stake digital assets. Your use of the Services is at your sole risk.</p>
