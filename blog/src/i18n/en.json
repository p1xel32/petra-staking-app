        "title": "Technology & Architecture",
        "questions": [
          { "id": "how-does-aptos-work", "question": "How does Aptos work?", "answer": "Aptos processes transactions in parallel using Block-STM, utilizes the Move programming language for secure smart contracts, and employs a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism (like AptosBFT, evolving towards Raptr) based on Proof-of-Stake for network security and efficiency." },
          { "id": "what-is-the-move-programming-language", "question": "What is the Move programming language and why is it used on Aptos?", "answer": "Move is a flexible and modular programming language originally developed for the Diem project, designed specifically for safe and secure smart contract development. It offers features like resource-oriented programming, strong data abstraction, and formal verification capabilities to prevent common vulnerabilities and manage digital assets securely." },
          { "id": "how-does-aptos-process-transactions", "question": "How does Aptos process transactions for high throughput?", "answer": "Aptos uses the Block-STM (Software Transactional Memory) engine for parallel execution. This allows the network to process multiple transactions simultaneously, rather than sequentially, significantly increasing network throughput (TPS) and reducing latency." },
          { "id": "what-is-block-stm", "question": "What is Block-STM and how does it enable parallel execution?", "answer": "Block-STM is Aptos's parallel execution engine.

          { "id": "what-consensus-mechanism-does-aptos-use", "question": "What consensus mechanism does Aptos use?", "answer": "Aptos initially used AptosBFT, an evolution of HotStuff. The consensus layer is designed to be modular and is evolving, with developments like Narwhal & Bullshark for mempool/consensus separation, and Raptr for even higher performance. It operates on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model." },
          { "id": "dev-raptr-consensus-explained", "question": "What is Raptr consensus and its key features for Aptos?", "answer": "Raptr is a next-generation Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol developed for the Aptos blockchain, designed to deliver high transaction speeds and near-instantaneous finality while maintaining robustness." },
          { "id": "dev-shardines-overview", "question": "What is Shardines (Shared State Scaling) on Aptos and how does it aim to increase TPS?", "answer": "Shardines is a novel sharded execution engine introduced by Aptos Labs, designed to dramatically increase the transaction processing capacity (TPS) of the Aptos blockchain through shared state scaling. It represents a key component of Aptos's strategy to achieve massive horizontal scalability, aiming for capabilities like 1 million TPS for non-conflicting transactions and over 500,000 TPS for conflicting ones." },
          { "id": "how-does-aptos-ensure-safety-and-security", "question": "How does Aptos ensure safety and security at the protocol level?", "answer": "Aptos ensures security through multiple layers: the Move language's safety features (preventing reentrancy, ensuring resource safety), a robust BFT consensus mechanism, on-chain governance for upgrades, built-in protections against many smart contract vulnerabilities, and its decentralized validator system. Read more about Aptos security on the [aptcore.one blog](https://aptcore.one)." },
          { "id": "what-are-resources-in-aptos", "question": "What are 'resources' in Aptos and how do they differ from regular data?", "answer": "In Aptos, 'resources' are special struct instances in the Move language that have the 'key' ability. They represent scarce or valuable digital assets and cannot be copied or implicitly discarded, only moved between storage locations. This ensures safe and precise management of assets like tokens or NFTs, governed by Move modules (smart contracts)." },
          { "id": "how-are-accounts-structured-on-aptos", "question": "How are accounts structured on Aptos?", "answer": "Aptos accounts are identified by an account address. They can store Move modules (smart contracts) and resources (data like tokens). Account access is controlled by authentication keys, and interactions are governed by the logic defined in Move modules." },
          { "id": "what-are-events-in-aptos", "question": "What are events in Aptos and how are they used by dApps?", "answer": "Events in Aptos are signals emitted by smart contracts (Move modules) to notify off-chain applications or users about specific occurrences or state changes on the blockchain. DApps can subscribe to these events to react to on-chain activities." },
          { "id": "how-does-aptos-handle-data-storage", "question": "How does Aptos handle data storage to prevent state bloat?", "answer": "Aptos uses an optimized Merkle tree-like structure (Jellyfish Merkle Tree) for its ledger state. This, along with features like state rent or sharding in the future, helps manage data efficiently, reduce storage demands on validators, and mitigate long-term 'state bloat'." },
          { "id": "what-is-an-epoch-in-aptos", "question": "What is an 'epoch' in Aptos and its significance?", "answer": "An 'epoch' in Aptos is a defined time period (currently around two hours or 7200 seconds) during which a specific set of validators participates in consensus. At the end of each epoch, network operations like staking reward distribution, validator set changes (based on stake amounts), and some governance actions can occur." },
          { "id": "how-do-aggregators-help-with-parallelization", "question": "How do Aggregators in Move help with parallel transaction execution, for example, in NFT mints?", "answer": "Aggregators in Move are a feature designed to handle high-contention scenarios more efficiently. They allow for deferred reads and writes to shared numeric values (like a counter in an NFT mint), enabling many transactions that would otherwise conflict to execute in parallel and have their effects combined correctly at the end, thus improving throughput." }

        "title": "APT Token & Tokenomics",
        "questions": [
          { "id": "what-is-the-native-token-of-aptos", "question": "What is the native token of Aptos, and what is its symbol?", "answer": "The native token of the Aptos blockchain is APT." },
          { "id": "what-are-the-use-cases-of-apt-token", "question": "What are the primary use cases of the APT token?", "answer": "APT is used for: 1. Paying transaction and network fees. 2. Staking to participate in the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, securing the network, and earning rewards. 3. Participating in on-chain governance by voting on proposals. 4. Potentially as a medium of exchange within dApps built on Aptos." },
          { "id": "where-can-i-find-info-on-aptos-tokenomics", "question": "Where can I find official information about Aptos tokenomics?", "answer": "Official information about Aptos tokenomics, including distribution and supply schedules, can be found in the \"Aptos Tokenomics Overview\" and related documents published by the Aptos Foundation. You can often find this on their official website." },
          { "id": "what-was-initial-total-supply-of-apt", "question": "What was the initial total supply of APT tokens at the mainnet launch?", "answer": "The initial total supply of APT at the mainnet launch on October 12, 2022, was 1 billion tokens." },
          { "id": "what-is-the-smallest-unit-of-apt", "question": "What is the smallest denomination of the APT token?", "answer": "The smallest unit of APT is called an Octa. One APT is equal to 100,000,000 Octas (APT has 8 decimal places)." },
          { "id": "how-are-apt-tokens-distributed", "question": "What was the initial distribution plan for APT tokens?", "answer": "APT tokens were initially allocated to several categories: Community (51.02%), Core Contributors (19.00%), Foundation (13.48%), and Investors (16.50%). These allocations typically have vesting schedules." },
          { "id": "are-there-lock-up-schedules-for-apt-tokens", "question": "Are there lock-up (vesting) schedules for APT tokens allocated to core contributors and investors?", "answer": "Yes, tokens allocated to investors and core contributors are subject to a multi-year lock-up (vesting) schedule from the mainnet launch, with phased monthly unlocks after an initial cliff period (e.g., no unlocks for the first 12 months)." },
          { "id": "what-percentage-of-apt-tokens-are-staked", "question": "What percentage of eligible APT tokens are typically staked on the network?", "answer": "A significant portion of APT tokens is usually staked, contributing to network security. For current, precise figures on the percentage of staked APT, it's best to refer to an official Aptos block explorer or dedicated staking analytics platforms like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one)." },
          { "id": "can-locked-apt-tokens-be-staked", "question": "Can APT tokens that are subject to lock-up (vesting) schedules still be staked?", "answer": "Yes, both unlocked (liquid) APT tokens and locked APT tokens (those still under vesting schedules) can be staked on the Aptos network to earn rewards." },
          { "id": "how-does-apt-token-supply-change", "question": "How does the total supply of APT tokens change over time?", "answer": "The total supply of APT primarily increases due to the minting of new tokens for staking rewards. The maximum reward rate for staking is designed to decrease over time. Transaction fees, if burned, can act as a deflationary pressure." },
          { "id": "are-aptos-transaction-fees-burned", "question": "Are transaction fees on the Aptos network burned?", "answer": "Currently, transaction fees collected on the Aptos network are burned (removed from circulation). However, this mechanism, like other tokenomic parameters, can be changed in the future through on-chain governance." },
          { "id": "can-aptos-tokenomics-be-changed", "question": "Can Aptos tokenomics (e.g., reward rates, fee burn mechanism) be changed after launch?", "answer": "Yes, key tokenomic parameters such as staking reward rates, reward distribution mechanisms, and transaction fee handling (e.g., burning) can be modified through the Aptos on-chain governance process, requiring votes from APT token holders." },
          { "id": "aptos-token-supply-api-changes", "question": "The Aptos Token Supply API sometimes gets updated. How should developers handle these changes?", "answer": "When a critical API like the Aptos Token Supply API is updated, developers should take several steps: \n1. **Monitor Official Announcements:** Follow official Aptos channels (e.g., developer blogs, forums, Discord) for news about API changes, deprecation notices, and migration guides. \n2. **Review API Documentation:** Carefully read the updated API documentation to understand changes in endpoints, data structures, request/response formats, rate limits, and authentication methods. \n3. **Test Thoroughly:** Implement changes in a development or staging environment first. Test all dependent functionalities extensively to ensure compatibility and correct data parsing. \n4. **Implement Versioning (if available):** If the API supports versioning, consider pinning to a specific version to avoid unexpected breakages, and plan upgrades methodically. \n5. **Error Handling & Fallbacks:** Improve error handling in your application to gracefully manage potential API issues during a transition. Consider temporary fallbacks if feasible. \n6. **Community Channels:** Engage with the Aptos developer community to share experiences and solutions for handling the update." }

          { "id": "dev-dynamic-script-composer-status-usage", "question": "What is the Dynamic Script Composer (DSC) in the Aptos SDK, its current status, and best practices for use?", "answer": "The Dynamic Script Composer (DSC) is a feature in the Aptos TypeScript SDK designed to allow developers to construct complex, atomic multi-step transactions programmatically without needing to write and deploy new on-chain Move modules for every unique sequence of operations. \n**Current Status:** The status of DSC can evolve. It was noted in research that it might have been temporarily removed from the main SDK for refinement (e.g., due to bundle size) with plans to reintroduce it, possibly as a separate extension package. Developers should check the latest Aptos TypeScript SDK documentation and release notes for its current availability and packaging. \n**Best Practices for Use:** \n1. **Understand Limitations:** Be aware of its capabilities regarding transaction complexity, gas costs of composed scripts, and supported Move features. \n2. **Ensure Atomicity:** Verify that the composed sequence behaves as expected atomically. \n3. **Security:** Though leveraging Move's safety, carefully validate all inputs and permissions when constructing transaction logic off-chain. \n4. **Gas Estimation:** Estimate and manage gas costs for composed transactions. \n5. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for both script composition and on-chain execution." },
          { "id": "dev-move-mutation-testing-guide", "question": "How can Move Mutation Testers (e.g., move-mutator) be practically used to improve smart contract tests and specifications on Aptos?", "answer": "Move Mutation Testers (like `move-mutator` or `move-spec-test`) are advanced tools that help assess and improve the quality of your test suites and formal specifications for Move smart contracts. \n**Practical Use:** \n1. **Assess Test Suite Quality:** The mutator introduces small, deliberate changes (mutations) into your smart contract code. If your existing tests fail to detect these mutated (and thus likely incorrect) versions of the code, it indicates a weakness or gap in your test coverage. \n2. **Identify Specification Blind Spots:** Similarly, when applied to formal specifications written in Move Specification Language (MSL), mutation testing can reveal if your specifications are robust enough to catch incorrect code implementations. \n3. **Iterative Improvement:** By analyzing which mutants \"survive\" (i.e., are not caught by tests/specs), developers can write more comprehensive tests and refine their MSL specifications to cover those edge cases or unhandled scenarios. \n4. **CI/CD Integration:** These tools can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to continuously monitor and enforce test/specification quality. \nTo use them effectively, developers need to understand how to run the tools, interpret their output (e.g., mutation scores), and then write targeted tests or spec conditions." },
          { "id": "dev-move2-advanced-features-guide", "question": "What are advanced features in Move 2.x like Function Values and enhanced Dynamic Dispatch, and how can they be used safely and effectively?", "answer": "Move 2.x (referring to versions of Move post initial launch, incorporating significant AIPs) introduced advanced features enhancing expressiveness and capabilities: \n1. **Function Values (Storable Functions):** Allows functions to be treated as values—passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and stored in resources. This enables patterns like callbacks, strategy patterns, and dynamic dispatch tables. Safe usage involves understanding their interaction with Move's ownership and borrowing system, ensuring type safety, and managing their lifecycle correctly, especially when stored. \n2. **Enhanced Safe Dynamic Dispatch:** Provides mechanisms for more flexible (yet still safe) dynamic calls between modules, often leveraging function values or trait-like interfaces. While Move aims for safer dynamic dispatch than some other chains (e.g., by making access control part of type definitions), developers must still be cautious about reentrancy patterns (though Move has built-in reentrancy locks for public functions) and ensure proper permissioning and validation for dynamic calls. \n**Effective & Safe Use:** \n* Thoroughly understand Move's type system, ownership, and reference safety, especially how these new features interact with them. \n* Write comprehensive unit tests and consider formal verification for contracts using these advanced features. \n* Study official examples and documentation from Aptos Labs on these specific features. \n* Be aware of potential new classes of logical errors if not used with care.

          { "id": "how-aptos-achieves-high-throughput-low-latency", "question": "What architectural features allow Aptos to achieve high throughput and low latency?", "answer": "Aptos achieves high performance primarily through: 1. **Parallel Transaction Execution:** Using Block-STM to process many transactions simultaneously. 2. **Efficient BFT Consensus:** Employing optimized versions of Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus (like AptosBFT, and evolving with Raptr). 3. **Move Language:** Designed for efficiency and safety. 4. **Pipelined Processing:** Overlapping different stages of transaction processing (execution, storage, consensus) to maximize hardware utilization." },
          { "id": "what-is-aptos-target-tps", "question": "What is Aptos's target or demonstrated TPS (Transactions Per Second)?", "answer": "Aptos has demonstrated very high TPS capabilities in test environments, with targets often cited in the tens of thousands or even over 100,000 TPS under ideal conditions. Real-world mainnet performance depends on various factors including network load, transaction complexity, and ongoing optimizations. Check current network explorers for live data." },
          { "id": "how-aptos-addresses-scalability", "question": "How does the Aptos blockchain plan to address long-term scalability?", "answer": "Aptos addresses scalability through its core design for parallel execution (Block-STM) and efficient resource management. Future plans include further optimizations and potentially state sharding (like the discussed Shardines concept) to horizontally scale transaction processing capacity as the network and user base grow." },
          { "id": "what-are-hardware-requirements-for-aptos-nodes", "question": "What are the typical hardware requirements for running Aptos validator or full nodes, and how does this impact performance and cost?", "answer": "Aptos aims for hardware efficiency to encourage decentralization. While specific requirements are provided in the official documentation (and can evolve), they generally involve multi-core CPUs, sufficient RAM, fast SSD storage, and high-bandwidth internet. Using bare metal infrastructure is often cited as beneficial for achieving optimal performance for validators, which can influence operational costs." },
          { "id": "has-aptos-experienced-technical-issues-downtime", "question": "Has the Aptos network experienced any significant technical issues, downtime, or network halts since its mainnet launch?", "answer": "Like any complex blockchain network, Aptos may encounter technical challenges or require maintenance. For information on past incidents, network status, or scheduled maintenance, it is best to refer to official Aptos Foundation announcements, status pages, and community channels. For aptcore.one's uptime record as a validator, please visit [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one)." },
          { "id": "aptos-developer-activity-codebase-concerns", "question": "Are there any notable concerns or discussions regarding Aptos developer activity, GitHub commits, or codebase licensing?", "answer": "The health of a blockchain project often involves active development and adherence to open-source principles. For current insights into Aptos developer activity, commit rates, and discussions around its codebase or licensing (which is generally open-source, evolving from Diem's original code), refer to official Aptos GitHub repositories, developer community discussions, and blockchain analytics platforms." },
          { "id": "what-is-state-bloat-how-aptos-handles-it", "question": "What is \"state bloat\" in blockchains, and how does Aptos plan to manage it?", "answer": "State bloat refers to the continuous growth of data that full nodes must store and process, which can lead to increased hardware requirements and centralization over time. Aptos is designed with mitigations such as an optimized data structure for its ledger state (Jellyfish Merkle Tree) and has explored concepts like state rent or advanced sharding to manage state growth efficiently." },

        "title": "Staking Fundamentals",
        "questions": [
          { "id": "what-is-aptos-apt-staking", "question": "What is Aptos (APT) staking and why is it important?", "answer": "Aptos (APT) staking is the process where token holders lock up their APT to actively participate in the network's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. By delegating tokens to a validator like https://aptcore.one, stakers help secure the network, validate transactions, and in return, earn staking rewards. It's crucial for network health and decentralization." },
          { "id": "how-does-aptos-staking-work", "question": "Can you explain the basic mechanism of how Aptos staking works?", "answer": "In Aptos, APT holders can delegate their tokens to a chosen validator (e.g., aptcore.one) or a delegation pool. These validators use the collective stake to participate in consensus: validating transactions and proposing new blocks. Successful participation earns rewards, which are then distributed proportionally to the validator and its delegators, after deducting any validator commission. Aptos also features an \"owner-operator-voter\" model that separates roles for enhanced security in staking operations." },
          { "id": "what-are-benefits-of-staking-aptos-apt", "question": "What are the main benefits of staking my Aptos (APT) tokens?", "answer": "The primary benefits of staking APT include: 1. **Earning Rewards:** You receive additional APT as a reward for helping secure the network. 2. **Network Security:** Your stake contributes to the overall security and integrity of the Aptos blockchain. 3. **Preventing Dilution:** As new tokens are minted for rewards, staking helps maintain or grow your share of the network. 4. **Supporting Validators:** You can support validators like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one) whose vision and service you align with." },
          { "id": "what-happens-when-i-stake-my-apt", "question": "What technically happens to my APT when I stake them?", "answer": "When you stake your APT, you are essentially assigning their \"voting power\" to a validator. The tokens are locked in a staking contract on the blockchain and are not spendable for other purposes. They remain in your custody if using a non-custodial staking method, but are committed to the validator you chose." },
          { "id": "is-staked-apt-locked", "question": "Are my APT tokens locked when I stake them?", "answer": "Yes, when you stake APT, those tokens are locked and cannot be transferred or used for other transactions. To make them liquid again, you must first initiate an unstaking process, which involves an \"unbonding period\" before the tokens become available in your wallet." },
          { "id": "what-is-owner-operator-voter-model-staking-aptos", "question": "What is the \"owner-operator-voter model for staking\" in Aptos and its benefits?", "answer": "The owner-operator-voter model in Aptos separates key roles for staking operations to enhance security and flexibility:\n* **Owner:** The account that holds the staked APT funds.\n* **Operator:** The account authorized to manage the validator node's technical operations (e.g., updating keys, joining/leaving the validator set).\n* **Voter:** The account authorized to participate in on-chain governance votes using the staked tokens.\nThis separation allows an owner to delegate operational duties to a trusted operator and voting duties to another entity (or retain them) without giving them direct control over the staked funds." }

        "title": "Staking Process & Requirements",
        "questions": [
          { "id": "how-do-i-stake-apt", "question": "What are the general steps to stake my APT tokens?", "answer": "To stake APT: 1. Ensure you have APT in an Aptos-compatible wallet (e.g., Petra). 2. Choose a staking provider or validator, like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one). 3. Use your wallet to connect to the staking interface of your chosen provider. 4. Select the amount of APT you wish to delegate. 5. Authorize and confirm the staking transaction. Always ensure you are interacting with legitimate platforms." },
          { "id": "what-is-minimum-amount-to-start-staking-apt", "question": "What is the minimum amount of APT required to start staking (delegating)?", "answer": "The minimum amount of APT required to delegate to a validator can vary depending on the validator or staking platform. Some allow staking with as little as 10 or 11 APT. However, for a validator node itself to become active in the consensus set, it needs a total stake of 1 million APT. Check with [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one) for our specific minimum delegation amount." },
          { "id": "minimum-additional-apt-to-stake", "question": "If I am already staking APT and want to stake additional APT, what is the minimum?", "answer": "The minimum amount for adding more APT to an existing stake is usually very low, often less than 1 APT, but this can depend on the specific staking platform or wallet interface you are using." },
          { "id": "apt-minimum-reserve-in-wallet", "question": "Do I need to keep a minimum reserve of APT in my wallet when staking?", "answer": "It is generally recommended to keep a small amount of APT (e.g., 0.05 APT or more) liquid in your wallet. This is to cover network transaction fees for future actions, such as staking more APT, unstaking, or claiming rewards (if manual claiming is required by a specific process)." },
          { "id": "are-there-transaction-fees-for-staking-apt", "question": "Are there transaction fees associated with staking, unstaking, or claiming APT rewards?", "answer": "Yes, all operations on the Aptos blockchain, including staking, unstaking, and (if applicable) claiming rewards, are transactions that require network fees. These fees are paid in APT and cover the computational resources used by the network." },
          { "id": "which-validator-delegating-funds-to", "question": "If I use a third-party wallet or platform for staking, how do I know which validator my APT is delegated to?", "answer": "Some wallets or platforms may automatically delegate your APT to a specific partner validator (e.g., Exodus historically used Everstake). Ideally, the platform should clearly display which validator your funds are being delegated to. When staking directly with a service like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one), you are choosing us as your validator." },
          { "id": "how-long-for-apt-to-finish-staking", "question": "After I initiate a staking transaction, how long does it take for my APT to be considered fully staked and start earning rewards?", "answer": "Once your staking transaction is confirmed on the Aptos blockchain, your APT typically becomes fully staked and eligible to earn rewards at the beginning of the next epoch. An epoch on Aptos is approximately two hours long." },
          { "id": "do-funds-move-out-wallet-when-staking", "question": "When I stake my APT using a non-custodial solution, do my funds move out of my wallet to another wallet?", "answer": "With non-custodial staking, your APT tokens are typically delegated to a smart contract associated with the validator you choose. While they are locked and committed to staking, you retain ownership and control via your wallet's private keys. The funds do not move to the validator's personal wallet; you always have the sole authority to initiate unstaking." },
          { "id": "can-i-select-how-much-wallet-balance-to-stake-apt", "question": "Can I choose to stake only a portion of my APT wallet balance?", "answer": "Yes, generally, you can select the specific amount of APT from your available wallet balance that you wish to stake. This is subject to any minimum staking amounts required by the network or the specific staking platform/validator you are using, such as." },
          { "id": "why-is-my-apt-validator-inactive", "question": "I delegated to an APT validator, but it shows as \"inactive\". Why would this happen?", "answer": "A validator might be inactive if its total pooled stake (from the operator and all delegators) has not yet reached the minimum threshold required by the Aptos protocol (currently 1 million APT) to join the active validator set. It will remain pending until it meets this threshold and can then become active at an epoch change." }

        "title": "Staking Rewards",
        "questions": [
          { "id": "how-often-aptos-staking-rewards-distributed", "question": "How frequently are Aptos staking rewards distributed to stakers?", "answer": "Aptos staking rewards are calculated and distributed at the end of every epoch. An epoch on Aptos currently lasts approximately two hours (7200 seconds). You can monitor your rewards with [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one)." },
          { "id": "are-aptos-staking-rewards-auto-compounded", "question": "Are my Aptos staking rewards automatically compounded?", "answer": "Yes, on the Aptos network, staking rewards are typically auto-compounded. This means the rewards you earn are automatically added to your staked principal, and subsequent rewards will be calculated based on this new, larger staked amount." },
          { "id": "when-will-i-start-earning-rewards-after-staking-apt", "question": "Exactly when will I start earning rewards after I stake my APT?", "answer": "You will typically start earning rewards once your APT delegation becomes active, which usually occurs at the beginning of the epoch following your staking transaction (an epoch is ~2 hours). Rewards are then accrued during that epoch and distributed at its end." },
          { "id": "do-i-need-to-claim-my-apt-rewards", "question": "Do I need to manually claim my APT staking rewards?", "answer": "No, generally you do not need to manually claim APT staking rewards. Due to the auto-compounding feature of the Aptos network, rewards are automatically added to your staked balance each epoch." },
          { "id": "how-are-aptos-staking-rewards-calculated-detailed", "question": "Can you provide more details on how Aptos staking rewards are calculated?", "answer": "Staking rewards are influenced by several factors: the network's overall `rewards_rate` (APY), the total amount of APT you have staked, the chosen validator's performance (uptime and success in proposing blocks), and the commission rate charged by the validator. Higher stake and better validator performance generally lead to higher rewards, minus the validator's commission. For aptcore.one's commission and performance details, visit [our staking page on aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one)." },
          { "id": "what-is-rewards-rate-apy-for-staking-apt", "question": "What is the current `rewards_rate` or Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for staking APT?", "answer": "The maximum staking reward rate on Aptos started at 7% annually and is designed to decrease by 1.5% per year until it reaches a lower bound of 3.25% annually (this reduction happens over many years). The actual APY you receive will also depend on validator commission and performance. For current estimated APY with aptcore.one, see [our staking calculator/page on aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one)." },
          { "id": "what-is-nrr-network-reward-rate-aptos", "question": "What does NRR (Network Reward Rate) refer to in the Aptos network?", "answer": "NRR, or Network Reward Rate, generally refers to the total rate at which new APT tokens are minted and distributed as rewards across the entire Aptos network to all participating stakers and validators for their contributions to network security and consensus, before individual validator performance or commissions are factored in." },
          { "id": "are-validator-rewards-subject-to-lockup-aptos", "question": "Are the rewards earned by validators also subject to a lockup period?", "answer": "Yes, rewards earned by validators (both their self-stake and the portion due to delegators before commission) are typically added to their staked principal. As such, these rewards are subject to the same lockup and unbonding conditions as the original staked amounts until an unstaking process is initiated." },
          { "id": "how-is-balance-computed-epoch-n-rewards-distribution-aptos", "question": "For reward distribution in Epoch N, which balance is used for calculation?", "answer": "Typically, the rewards distributed at the end of Epoch N are calculated based on the active staked balance at the beginning of Epoch N (which is effectively the balance at the end of Epoch N-1, after the previous rewards were compounded)." },
          { "id": "how-is-commission-paid-to-validators-operators-aptos", "question": "How is the commission actually paid to validators or staking service operators?", "answer": "Validators or staking services like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one) set a commission rate. This percentage is automatically deducted from the gross rewards earned by their delegators' stake before the net rewards are compounded to the delegators' staked balance each epoch. The collected commission then accrues to the validator." }

        "title": "Unstaking Process & Lockup",
        "questions": [
          { "id": "how-do-i-unstake-apt", "question": "What are the steps to unstake my APT tokens?", "answer": "To unstake APT, you will typically use the interface of the wallet or staking platform (like [aptcore.one's dashboard](https://aptcore.one)) where you initially staked your tokens. You'll look for an \"unstake,\" \"unlock,\" or \"withdraw stake\" option, specify the amount (if partial unstaking is supported), and confirm the transaction. This initiates the unbonding period." },
          { "id": "is-there-unstaking-period-aptos", "question": "Is there an unstaking (unbonding or lockup) period when I decide to unstake my Aptos (APT)?", "answer": "Yes, the Aptos network has an unbonding period. When you request to unstake your APT, the tokens enter this period during which they are no longer actively earning new staking rewards but are not yet liquid or available for transfer." },
          { "id": "how-long-is-unstaking-period-aptos", "question": "How long is the unstaking/unbonding period for Aptos? When will my APT be available after unstaking?", "answer": "The unstaking lockup period on Aptos is determined by on-chain governance and is typically around 14 days. Your APT tokens become available for withdrawal after this 14-day period concludes, often aligning with the end of the specific lockup cycle your stake was part of when you initiated the unstake." },
          { "id": "how-does-unstaking-work-aptos-detailed", "question": "Can you explain the Aptos unstaking process in more detail?", "answer": "When you initiate an unstake request, your specified amount of staked APT (plus any auto-compounded rewards associated with that principal) is marked for unbonding. These tokens stop earning new rewards. They remain locked for the duration of the current on-chain lockup period (e.g., 14 days). After this period expires, you must typically execute a final \"withdraw\" transaction to move the unlocked APT back to your liquid wallet balance." },
          { "id": "can-i-unstake-part-of-staked-balance-aptos", "question": "Can I unstake only a portion of my staked APT balance, or do I have to unstake everything?", "answer": "The ability to perform partial unstaking depends on the specific staking smart contract or the interface provided by your wallet/staking platform. Some solutions allow you to specify an amount to unstake (subject to minimums), while others might require unstaking the entire balance associated with a particular delegation or stake pool entry." },
          { "id": "do-i-need-to-claim-unstaked-apt-after-period-ends", "question": "After the unbonding period ends, do I need to manually claim my unstaked APT to make it liquid?", "answer": "Yes, typically on Aptos, after your staked APT has completed the unbonding (lockup) period, you must perform an additional transaction to \"withdraw\" or \"claim\" these unlocked tokens. This final step moves them from the staking contract back to your main wallet balance, making them spendable." },
          { "id": "how-can-i-withdraw-my-apt-unstaked-unlocked", "question": "Once my APT is unstaked and the lockup period is over, how do I actually withdraw the funds to my usable balance?", "answer": "After the unbonding period has finished, you will need to go back to your wallet or the staking platform you used (e.g., [aptcore.one's dashboard](https://aptcore.one)) and look for an option to \"withdraw stake\" or \"claim unlocked APT\". Executing this transaction will transfer the APT to your liquid wallet balance." },
          { "id": "does-unlocked-stake-continue-earning-rewards-aptos", "question": "During the unbonding (unlocking) period, does my stake continue to earn rewards?", "answer": "No, generally, once you initiate an unstake request and your APT enters the unbonding period, it stops accruing new staking rewards. Any rewards earned up until the point of initiating the unstake will typically be unlocked along with your principal amount." },
          { "id": "when-can-validator-request-unlock-stake-aptos", "question": "When can a validator operator request to unlock their (or their pool's) stake?", "answer": "A validator operator can submit a request to unlock their stake (or a portion of it, if supported by their pool setup) at any time. However, similar to delegators, the staked APT will only become withdrawable after the prevailing on-chain lockup period (e.g., 14 days from the last lock action for that stake) has expired." }

        "questions": [
          { "id": "is-staking-apt-safe", "question": "How safe is staking APT with a validator like aptcore.one?", "answer": "Staking APT involves certain risks, but choosing a reputable validator like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one) can mitigate some of them. With non-custodial staking, you retain control of your private keys, meaning the validator cannot directly access your funds. However, risks include: 1. **Market Risk:** The price of APT can fluctuate. 2. **Slashing Risk:** (See next question). 3. **Validator Downtime:** If a validator has poor uptime, it can affect your rewards. 4. **Smart Contract Bugs:** Though Move is designed for safety, no software is entirely without risk. We at aptcore.one prioritize security and operational excellence. Learn more at [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one)." },
          { "id": "is-there-slashing-risk-on-aptos", "question": "Is there a \"slashing\" risk when staking Aptos (APT)? What is it?", "answer": "Slashing is a penalty mechanism in Proof-of-Stake blockchains where a validator (and consequently their delegators) can lose a portion of their staked tokens for malicious behavior (like double-signing transactions) or extended downtime. While the Aptos protocol is designed with the capability for slashing, its activation and specific conditions are subject to on-chain governance. It's important to check the current network parameters and choose a reliable validator like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one) to minimize such risks if slashing is active." }

          { "id": "what-are-different-states-validator-can-be-in-aptos", "question": "What are the different operational states an Aptos validator can be in?", "answer": "An Aptos validator can be in one of several states: \n- `Registered`: The validator account is created on-chain but not yet part of any set.\n- `Inactive`: The validator has a stake pool but does not meet the minimum stake to join the active set, or has been removed.\n- `Pending Active`: The validator meets the minimum stake and is waiting to join the active validator set at the next epoch.\n- `Active`: The validator is currently participating in network consensus and earning rewards.\n- `Pending Inactive`: The validator has requested to leave the active set, or their stake fell below minimum, and they are waiting to become inactive at the next epoch." },
          { "id": "how-does-validator-move-between-states-aptos", "question": "How does an Aptos validator transition between these different operational states?", "answer": "Validators transition between states primarily at epoch boundaries. For example:\n- Joining: An operator registers, the owner stakes, and if minimums are met, the validator moves to `pending_active`, then `active`.\n- Leaving: An operator requests to leave, moving to `pending_inactive`, then `inactive`.\n- Forced Exit: If an active validator's stake falls below the minimum, it moves directly to `inactive`.\nThese transitions are managed by the Aptos protocol based on operator actions, stake levels, and governance." },
          { "id": "what-happens-if-validator-stake-falls-below-minimum-aptos", "question": "What happens if an active validator's total stake falls below the minimum required by the Aptos network?", "answer": "If an active validator's total stake (including all delegations) drops below the network minimum (currently 1 million APT), the validator will be moved from the `active` state directly to an `inactive` state during the next epoch change. They will stop participating in consensus and cease earning rewards until their stake meets the minimum again and they rejoin the active set." },
          { "id": "what-is-minimum-maximum-stake-for-validator-aptos", "question": "What is the minimum and maximum stake amount for an Aptos validator to be active and earn rewards effectively?", "answer": "To join and remain in the active validator set on Aptos, a validator must have a minimum total stake of 1 million APT. There is also a maximum effective stake per validator, currently 50 million APT. Stake beyond this maximum does not contribute further to the validator's voting power or reward share." },
          { "id": "what-happens-if-validator-stake-exceeds-maximum-aptos", "question": "What happens if a validator's total staked amount significantly exceeds the maximum effective stake limit?", "answer": "If a validator's total stake (e.g., 60 million APT) exceeds the maximum effective stake limit (e.g., 50 million APT), their voting power in consensus and their share of network rewards will be calculated as if their stake is only at that maximum limit. The additional stake beyond the cap does not provide extra rewards or voting influence for that specific validator node. Delegators to such a validator might see slightly diluted rewards if the validator doesn't manage their pool effectively." },
          { "id": "how-does-operator-join-validator-set-aptos", "question": "What are the steps for a new operator to set up a node and join the Aptos validator set?", "answer": "To join the Aptos validator set, an operator typically needs to: 1. Set up the physical or cloud infrastructure for a validator node and a (Validator) FullNode (VFN). 2. Install and configure the Aptos node software. 3. Generate and register on-chain the necessary accounts and keys (owner, operator, voter, consensus key, network identities). 4. The owner account must stake the minimum required APT (1 million) into the validator's stake pool. 5. The node must sync with the blockchain. 6. If all criteria are met, the validator can then be set to `pending_active` and will join the active set at an epoch change." },
          { "id": "can-validator-consensus-key-network-addresses-change-aptos", "question": "Can a validator's consensus key or network addresses be changed after they are active?", "answer": "Yes, an active validator can update its consensus key, validator network address, or fullnode network address(es) by submitting an on-chain transaction with the new information. These changes are queued and will typically take effect at the next epoch boundary to ensure a smooth transition without disrupting network consensus." },
          { "id": "connect-validator-to-vfn-not-other-way-around-aptos", "question": "Is it possible to configure an Aptos Validator node to initiate a connection to its VFN (Validator FullNode), rather than the VFN always connecting to the Validator?", "answer": "The standard Aptos network configuration involves Validator FullNodes (VFNs) being configured to connect to their associated Validator node to form a private fullnode network for resilience and security. For highly specific or alternative network topologies where a Validator might initiate outbound connections to its VFNs, you would need to consult advanced Aptos technical documentation or seek advice from the Aptos developer community, as this is not the typical setup." },

The exact amount is usually minimal. These testnet tokens can be obtained free of charge from the official Aptos faucet designated for the specific network you are using." }
