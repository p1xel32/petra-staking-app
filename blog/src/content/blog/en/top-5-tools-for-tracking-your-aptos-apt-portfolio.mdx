So, you’re staking your Aptos ($APT$) tokens. That's a great first step. But to truly maximize your returns and secure your investment, simply staking isn't enough. You need the right set of tools to monitor performance, track rewards, and make informed decisions. Manually tracking everything is not just difficult—it's inefficient.

Welcome to the ultimate Staker's Toolkit. We've compiled the top 5 essential dashboards and tools every Aptos staker needs. Whether you're just starting out and need a [beginner's guide to Aptos staking](/blog/aptos-staking-guide-beginners) or you're an experienced delegator, these tools will help you effectively track your Aptos portfolio.

### 1. Petra Wallet: Your Integrated Aptos Staking Command Center

For most users, **[Petra Wallet](https://petra.app/)** is the primary gateway to the Aptos ecosystem. Developed by Aptos Labs, it's a non-custodial wallet that doubles as a powerful, built-in staking dashboard.

* **Key Features for Stakers:**
    * **Direct Delegation:** Stake your $APT$ directly from the wallet interface.
    * **Reward Tracking:** Easily view your accumulated rewards in real-time.
    * **Simplified Management:** Add to your stake or initiate the unbonding process with just a few clicks.
* **Why it's in the toolkit:** Its core strength is convenience. For daily checks and basic staking operations, nothing beats managing your assets directly from the wallet you already use.

### 2. Aptos Explorer: The Official Source of On-Chain Truth

When you need to verify data with absolute certainty, the **[official Aptos Explorer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/)** is your go-to resource. It provides a direct, unfiltered look at all network activity, making it an indispensable tool for due diligence.

    * **Network Health:** Monitor overall network health and staking parameters.

### 3. Aptoscan: The User-Friendly Data Hub

While the official explorer is functional, third-party explorers like **[Aptoscan](https://aptoscan.com/)** often provide a much richer and more intuitive user experience. Aptoscan is a community favorite for turning complex blockchain data into easy-to-understand information.

* **Key Features for Stakers:**
    * **Enhanced Validator Stats:** Quickly compare validators based on commission, uptime, and current stake in a clean, sortable table.
    * **Clearer Account View:** Offers a more graphical and organized breakdown of your token holdings, transactions, and staking positions.

### 4. DeBank: The Holistic Multi-Chain Portfolio Tracker

Your $APT$ stake is likely just one piece of your crypto puzzle. **[DeBank](https://debank.com/)** is a leading portfolio tracker that gives you a bird's-eye view of all your assets across dozens of blockchains, including Aptos.

* **Key Features for Stakers:**
    * **Unified Dashboard:** Connect your Aptos wallet to see your staked $APT$ value alongside all your other DeFi positions, tokens, and NFTs.
    * **Net Worth Tracking:** Automatically calculates and displays your total net worth across all connected wallets and chains.
    * **Explore DeFi:** Discover other protocols and investment opportunities within the Aptos ecosystem and beyond.

### 5. Liquid Staking Dashboards (e.g., Amnis Finance)

Liquid staking is revolutionizing how users earn yield. Platforms like **[Amnis Finance](https://amnis.finance/)** allow you to stake your $APT$ and receive a liquid token (like $stAPT$) in return, which you can use in other DeFi applications—all while still earning staking rewards.

* **Key Features for Stakers:**
    * **Specialized Tracking:** These dashboards show the current exchange rate for the liquid staking token, which includes your accrued rewards.
    * **DeFi Integration:** Manage your staked assets and explore opportunities to use them for lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity.
    * **APY Insights:** Get a clear view of the APY, which often includes both staking rewards and potential DeFi yields. Dive deeper into this topic in our [Aptos liquid staking deep dive](/blog/aptos-liquid-staking-deep-dive).
* **Why it's in the toolkit:** This is an essential tool for advanced stakers looking to maximize capital efficiency and engage more deeply with the DeFi ecosystem.
