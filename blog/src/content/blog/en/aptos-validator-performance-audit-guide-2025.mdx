You've chosen a validator, delegated your APT, and watched your rewards trickle in. But have you ever stopped to ask: "Am I *really* maximizing my returns?"

Many stakers assume the advertised APY is what they'll get, but the reality is more complex. The performance and reliability of your chosen validator are the most critical factors determining your actual, take-home rewards. A validator with even slightly subpar performance can cost you a significant amount of APT over a year.

It's time to stop guessing. This guide will teach you how to perform a "health check" on your validator, using real data to see if they're truly working for you.

### Beyond Commission: The Three Pillars of Validator Performance

A low commission rate is attractive, but it's often a marketing tactic that masks poor performance. Here are the metrics that truly matter.

#### 1. Uptime: The Foundation of Everything

* **What it is:** Uptime is the percentage of time a validator is online, active, and successfully participating in the network's consensus mechanism.
* **Why it matters:** In each epoch, rewards are distributed to active validators. If your validator is offline or fails to participate in enough rounds of consensus (currently, the threshold is 70% participation per epoch on Aptos), they are considered "inactive" for that epoch. **This means neither the validator nor their stakers receive any rewards for that period.**
* **How to check it:**
    * Use a block explorer like [Aptoscan](https://aptoscan.com/) or [Aptos Explorer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/).
    * Navigate to the "Validators" section and find your validator.
    * Look for metrics like "Last Epoch Performance" or "Participation Rate." Consistent rates of **99%+** are the gold standard. Anything consistently below 95% is a red flag.

#### 2. Governance Participation: A Sign of Engagement

* **What it is:** This metric tracks how often a validator votes on on-chain governance proposals.
* **Why it matters:** While not directly tied to rewards *yet*, active participation in governance is a powerful indicator of a validator's long-term commitment and technical competence. They are not just passively running a server; they are actively shaping the future of Aptos. Protocols planning airdrops often use voting history as a key metric for identifying high-quality community members.
* **How to check it:**
    * Most explorers with a "Governance" tab will show recent proposals.
    * You can check the list of voting validators for each proposal to see if yours is participating.
    * A good validator rarely, if ever, misses a vote.

#### 3. Reward Accuracy & Payout Reliability

* **What it is:** This is the ultimate test. Are the rewards you are actually receiving in line with what you *should* be earning based on the network's overall performance?
* **Why it matters:** Technical glitches, misconfigured nodes, or even dishonest practices could lead to you receiving fewer rewards than you're entitled to.
* **How to check it (The Manual Audit):**
    1.  **Track the Network APY:** Use a tool or dashboard that shows the average network-wide staking APY for the last few epochs.
    2.  **Calculate Your Expected Rewards:** Use our [**Staking Rewards Calculator Guide**](link-to-your-calculator-guide-post) to determine your expected earnings for a specific period (e.g., one month), factoring in the network APY and your validator's commission.
    3.  **Compare with Your Actuals:** Check your wallet history. Do the rewards you've received match your calculation (within a small margin of error)?
    4.  If there's a significant, consistent discrepancy, your validator may be underperforming.

### The `aptcore.one` Standard

We believe in radical transparency because we're proud of our performance.
* **Institutional-Grade Uptime:** Our infrastructure is designed for near-100% uptime, ensuring you never miss out on rewards due to downtime.
* **Active Governance:** We are committed participants in Aptos governance, helping to steer the protocol toward a successful future.
* **Verifiable Rewards:** Our reward payouts are consistent and accurate, reflecting our optimized and efficient node operation.

### Your Action Plan: The 15-Minute Health Check

Set a calendar reminder once a quarter to perform this quick audit:
* [ ] **Check Uptime:** Is your validator's participation consistently >99%?
* [ ] **Check Governance:** Have they voted on the last 2-3 major proposals?
* [ ] **Spot-Check Rewards:** Do your recent rewards align with network performance and their commission?

If the answer to any of these is no, it might be time to redelegate your stake. Your APT deserves to work as hard as you do.
