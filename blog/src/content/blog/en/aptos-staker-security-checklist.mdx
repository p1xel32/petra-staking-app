Choosing a reliable and secure validator like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one) is a critical first step in your Aptos staking journey. However, the security of your staked `APT` doesn't end there. True security is a partnership between your validator's robust infrastructure and your own diligent security practices. Your personal setup—your wallet, your browser, and your awareness—is the frontline defense for your assets.

This article provides a practical, actionable checklist to enhance your personal security as an Aptos staker.

## The Staker's Security Checklist

Think of these points as non-negotiable rules for safeguarding your crypto.

### 1. Fortify Your Wallet Foundation

Your wallet is the key to your kingdom. Protecting it is paramount.

* **Use a Hardware Wallet:** This is the single most effective security upgrade you can make. Devices like Ledger keep your private keys completely offline, meaning they can't be accessed even if your computer is compromised. We have a [step-by-step guide on staking Aptos with a Ledger](/blog/how-to-stake-aptos-with-ledger-a-step-by-step-security-guide/) for this exact reason.
* **Guard Your Seed Phrase:** Treat your 12 or 24-word seed phrase like the ultimate password.
    * **Never** store it digitally (no screenshots, no text files, no password managers).
    * Write it down on paper or stamp it into metal and store it in multiple secure, physical locations.
    * **Never** share it with anyone. No legitimate admin or support agent will ever ask for it.
* **Bookmark Official Sites:** When connecting your wallet to a staking platform like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one), always use a trusted bookmark. This prevents you from accidentally landing on a phishing site that looks identical to the real one.

### 2. Master Anti-Phishing & Scam Prevention

Scammers target the human element, not just the technology.

* **Be Skeptical of "Too Good to Be True" Offers:** Unexpected airdrops, giveaways promising to double your APT, or DMs from "support staff" are almost always scams designed to get you to sign a malicious transaction.
* **Verify URLs and Social Handles:** Scammers create convincing fake websites and social media profiles. Always double-check that you are on the official domain and interacting with verified accounts.
* **Question Every "Urgent" Request:** Scams often create a false sense of urgency, pressuring you to act quickly before you can think. Slow down and verify everything before connecting your wallet or approving any transaction.

### 3. Practice Safe Smart Contract Interaction

When you venture into the wider Aptos DeFi ecosystem, you introduce new risks.

* **Understand What You're Signing:** When a dApp asks for a transaction signature, read the prompt carefully. Understand what permissions you are granting. Blindly signing transactions is how many wallets are drained.
* **Interact with Audited Protocols Only:** Before using a liquid staking or DeFi protocol, confirm that it has undergone rigorous, third-party security audits from reputable firms. Reputable projects will make these audit reports public.
* **Revoke Unnecessary Permissions:** From time to time, review and revoke active connections and permissions you've granted to dApps. If you are no longer using a platform, there is no reason for it to have access to your wallet.

## Conclusion: Security is a Continuous Practice

Staking on Aptos is a powerful way to participate in the network and earn rewards. But with great power comes great responsibility. By following this checklist, you build a formidable defense around your assets. Your security is an active process, not a one-time setup. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and pair your secure practices with a validator that prioritizes security at an institutional level.
