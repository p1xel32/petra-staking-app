## Secure Your Aptos Staking with a Ledger Hardware Wallet

Staking your Aptos (APT) tokens is an excellent way to earn rewards and support the network. However, security should always be your top priority when dealing with crypto assets. Using a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S Plus or Nano X provides an enhanced layer of security for your private keys, protecting them from online threats.

This guide will walk you through the step-by-step process of staking your Aptos (APT) using a Ledger device, typically in conjunction with a compatible software wallet like Petra. If you're new to Aptos staking, you might also find our [Aptos Staking Guide for Beginners](/blog/aptos-staking-guide-beginners) helpful.

### Why Use a Ledger for Aptos Staking?

* **Enhanced Security:** Your private keys, which control access to your APT, never leave the Ledger device. Transactions are signed offline within the secure chip of the hardware wallet.
* **Protection from Malware:** Software wallets can be vulnerable to malware and phishing attacks. A Ledger mitigates these risks significantly.
* **Peace of Mind:** Knowing your assets are secured by industry-leading hardware provides greater confidence when participating in staking.

### Prerequisites:

1.  **Ledger Hardware Wallet:** Ensure you have a Ledger Nano S Plus, Nano X, or other compatible model.
2.  **Ledger Live App:** Downloaded and installed on your computer or mobile device. Make sure it's updated to the latest version.
3.  **Aptos (APT) App on Ledger:** The Aptos application must be installed on your Ledger device via Ledger Live.
4.  **Compatible Software Wallet:** You'll need an Aptos software wallet that supports Ledger integration. Petra Wallet, the official wallet by Aptos Labs, is a common choice. Martian Wallet is another option. (You can read our [Comparison of Top Aptos Staking Wallets](/blog/comparing-top-aptos-staking-wallets) for more info).
5.  **APT Tokens:** You need APT tokens in your Ledger-controlled Aptos account. You also need to be aware of the [Aptos staking minimum](/blog/aptos-staking-minimum-how-much-apt-to-start).

### Step-by-Step Guide: Staking Aptos (APT) with Ledger and Petra Wallet

The general process involves using Ledger Live to manage the Aptos app on your device and then connecting your Ledger to a software wallet like Petra to interact with staking platforms.

**Step 1: Install the Aptos App on Your Ledger Device**

1.  Open the **Ledger Live** application on your computer.
2.  Connect your Ledger device and unlock it using your PIN.
3.  Navigate to the **Manager** section in Ledger Live.
4.  Allow Ledger Manager on your device if prompted.
5.  In the App catalog, search for "Aptos".
6.  Click **Install** next to the Aptos app.

**Step 2: Connect Your Ledger to Petra Wallet (or another compatible wallet)**

1.  Ensure your Ledger device is connected to your computer and unlocked, with the Aptos app open on the device.
2.  Install the **Petra Wallet** browser extension if you haven't already.
3.  Open Petra Wallet.
4.  Look for an option like "Connect Hardware Wallet," "Add Account," or "Import Ledger."
5.  Select "Ledger" as the hardware wallet type.
6.  Follow the on-screen prompts in Petra Wallet. It should detect your Ledger device. You may need to approve the connection on your Ledger device.
7.  Your Ledger-controlled Aptos account(s) should now appear in Petra Wallet.

**Step 3: Navigate to a Staking Platform (e.g., aptcore.one)**

1.  With your Ledger-controlled account selected in Petra Wallet, go to your chosen Aptos staking platform. For a reliable and user-friendly experience, consider [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one).
2.  On the staking platform, find the option to "Connect Wallet."
3.  Choose Petra Wallet (or the software wallet you connected your Ledger to).
4.  Your wallet should connect, displaying your APT balance from your Ledger account.

**Step 4: Choose a Validator and Delegate Your Stake**

1.  Select a validator or delegation pool. Our guide on [Choosing Your Aptos Staking Partner](/blog/choosing-aptos-staking-partner) provides key factors to consider. At `aptcore.one`, we prioritize transparency and performance.
2.  Enter the amount of APT you wish to stake.
3.  Initiate the staking transaction.

**Step 5: Approve the Transaction on Your Ledger Device**

1.  Petra Wallet (or your chosen software wallet) will prepare the transaction and send it to your Ledger device for signing.
2.  **Crucially, review the transaction details displayed on your Ledger device's screen.** Verify the amount, recipient (validator/pool address), and any fees.
3.  If all details are correct, **approve the transaction on your Ledger device** by pressing the appropriate buttons.
4.  Once approved on the Ledger, the signed transaction is sent back to the software wallet and then to the Aptos network.
