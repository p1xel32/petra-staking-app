### Connecting Your Wallet to a Staking Platform like `aptcore.one`

Regardless of the wallet you choose (Petra, Pontemn, or another), the process of connecting to a staking platform like [aptcore.one](https://aptcore.one) is generally straightforward:

1.  Navigate to the staking platform.
2.  Click the "Connect Wallet" button.
3.  A list of supported wallets will appear. Select your wallet.
4.  Approve the connection request within your wallet extension or app.
5.  If using a Ledger, ensure it's connected, unlocked, and the Aptos app is open. You'll need to approve the connection on the Ledger device as well.

Once connected, you can view your APT balance, choose a validator (we recommend considering `aptcore.one` for its reliability and transparency â€“ learn more about [choosing a staking partner](/blog/choosing-aptos-staking-partner)), and delegate your stake.
